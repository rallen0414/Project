# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Unsure at the moment

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A maze game where the user is forced to decide between two or more options with only one of them being the right one.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

We plan to build our game in Unity. The maze game will be built on if else statements to decide if the user made the correct decisions. A wrong choice will 
set the user back while a correct choice will progress the user further toward the end. We are not sure what else for now because we need to familiarize
ourselves with Unity.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Have a set maze path that is the same for every run through. A victory screen.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A timer where the player has to get out before it hits zero. Background music

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The maze path could be randomized every time so the same player can play multiple times without knowing the exact path out. An enemy that comes out if you go the wrong way.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

We need to look into how Unity works with tutorials on their website and YouTube. We also have to learn C# to be able to code our game. All three of us will
work on this in the upcoming days. Once we familiarize ourselves with Unity we can split up the work so one of us can work on the character, the maze and the
choices. If we find a better way to split up the work as we progress, we will do so.
